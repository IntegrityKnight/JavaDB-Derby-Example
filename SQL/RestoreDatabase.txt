Restoring a database from a backup copy
To restore a database by using a full backup from a specified location, specify the restoreFrom=path attribute in the boot-time connection URL.

If a database with the same name exists in the derby.system.home location, the system will delete the database, copy it from the backup location, and then restart it.

The log files are copied to the same location they were in when the backup was taken. You can use the logDevice attribute in conjunction with the restoreFrom=path attribute to store logs in a different location.

For example, to restore the sample database by using a backup copy in c:\mybackups\sample, the connection URL should be:
jdbc:derby:sample;restoreFrom=c:\mybackups\sample
For more information, see "restoreFrom=path attribute" in the Derby Reference Manual.
